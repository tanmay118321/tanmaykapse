Welcome to Mechanical Engineering Program at Government Polytechnic, Gondia. I have the honour of directing the Mechanical Engineering Program, together with our well qualified faculty and staff. Itâ€™s my pleasure to inspire the students to achieve Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) framed by MSBTE as per NBA guidelines.
<div class="vision">
    Our Vision
</div><br>
To Serve the Industry and Society by Imparting Technical Knowledge and Skills through the Mechanical Engineering program.<br>

<div class="vision">
    Mission
</div><br>
To impart technical knowledge and professional ethics by using modern engineering tools with supportive facilities.<br>
To inculcate ethical values and leadership qualities in societal and environmental context.<br>
To impart lifelong learning by modern management tools, experiments and practices.<br>
To fulfil industrial and societal needs by establishing interactions with industries and providing solutions to them.<br><br>
<div class="vision">
    Program Educational Objectives (PEOs)
</div><br>
PEO1: Provide socially responsible, environment friendly solutions to mechanical engineering related broad-based problems adapting professional ethics<br>
PEO2: Adapt state-of-the-art mechanical engineering broad based technologies to work in Multi-disciplinary work environment<br>
PEO3: Solve broad based problems individually and as a team member communicating effectively in the world of work.<br><br>
Program Outcomes (POs)<div class="vision">
    Program Outcomes (POs)
</div><br>
PO1:Basic and Discipline Specific Knowledge: Apply knowledge of basic Mathematics, Science, Engineering fundamentals and engineering specialization to solve the engineering problems.<br>
