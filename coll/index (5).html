Welcome to Computer Engineering Program at Government Polytechnic, Gondia. I have the honour of directing the Computer Engineering Program, together with our well qualified faculty and staff. It is my pleasure to inspire the students to achieve Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) framed by MSBTE as per NBA guidelines.

<div class="vision">
    Our Vision
</div>
To strive for the development of technicians and empower them to face everchanging challenges in the field of Computer Engineering.<br>
<div style="background-color: rgb(157, 159, 161);">
    <h2> Mission</h2>
</div>
M1:To impart knowledge through teaching learning process to cater the needs of industries and higher education for life-long learning.<br>
M2:To imbibe ethical values and professional competencies.<br>
M3:To provide environment friendly solutions to solve real life problems.<br>
M4:To inculcate leadership qualities to solve problems of industry and Society.<br>
<div style="background-color: rgb(157, 159, 161);">
    <h2> Program Educational Objectives(PEO)</h2>
</div><br>
PEO1: Provide socially responsible, environment friendly solutions to computer engineering related broad-based problems adapting professional ethics.<br>
